Project Overview
This project involves the creation of a Python-based module to automatically detect faces in static images and to predict the gender and age of the detected individuals using a deep learning-based model.

Features
Face Detection: Utilizes a pre-trained deep learning model to detect faces in an image.
Gender Prediction: Classifies the detected face as male or female.
Age Prediction: Estimates the age of the detected individual
The following modules are required; cv2, open cv, dilib, tenzaflow,kelras,nampie ,matplotlib
The following pretrained  models are needed ;age_gender_estimation
